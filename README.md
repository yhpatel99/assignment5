# Assignment 5 - Statistical Analysis of NBA Player Performance

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to perform a statistical analysis on NBA player performance data, specifically focusing on Field Goals Made (FGM) and Field Goals Attempted (FGA). The analysis includes calculating key statistical measures, performing relational and individual t-tests, and comparing the results.

## Description

This assignment involves the following steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset containing NBA player statistics is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Filtering Data**: The dataset is filtered to include only regular season data.
3. **Calculating Statistical Measures**: Key statistical measures (mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis) are calculated for the FGM and FGA columns.
4. **Performing Relational T-Test**: A relational t-test is performed to compare the FGM and FGA columns.
5. **Performing Individual T-Tests**: Individual t-tests are performed on the FGM and FGA columns to test if their means are different from zero.
6. **Comparing T-Test Results**: The results of the individual t-tests are compared to the relational t-test to understand the differences in statistical significance.


## Output

The script will print the following information to the console:

- Statistical measures (mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis) for FGM and FGA.
- Results of the relational t-test between FGM and FGA.
- Results of the individual t-tests for FGM and FGA.
- Comparison of the p-values from the relational and individual t-tests.

## Conclusion

This assignment provides an analysis of NBA player performance data, focusing on field goals. By calculating statistical measures and performing t-tests, we can gain insights into the distribution and significance of the data.
